Here's a capstone project idea that will effectively showcase the use of interfaces in PHP OOP:

Project Title: E-commerce Payment Gateway Integration
Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to build an E-commerce payment processing system that integrates multiple payment gateways. The project will focus on applying interfaces to define the structure for different payment gateway implementations. Students will learn how to create a flexible and scalable architecture that supports various payment processors without modifying core functionality, making it a good demonstration of the Open/Closed Principle as well.

Project Objectives:
Use interfaces to enforce a common contract for different payment gateways.
Implement multiple payment gateways (e.g., PayPal, Stripe, Bank Transfer) that adhere to the common interface.
Integrate dependency injection to improve flexibility and reusability.
Implement exception handling and transaction logging to simulate real-world payment scenarios.

Core Features:
PaymentGateway Interface:

Define an interface PaymentGateway with essential methods like processPayment(), refund(), and generateReceipt().
Specify parameters and return types, making it a strict contract for any payment service provider.
Concrete Implementations:

Create classes like PayPalGateway, StripeGateway, and BankTransferGateway that implement the PaymentGateway interface.
Each class should define specific implementations of the processPayment(), refund(), and generateReceipt() methods.
Transaction Manager:

Implement a TransactionManager class that accepts any PaymentGateway object, allowing users to switch payment methods easily.
Use dependency injection to dynamically inject different payment gateway objects, making the system modular and extensible.
Transaction Logging:

Integrate logging for each transaction step (initiating payment, completing transaction, etc.) to track transaction statuses.
Use a basic file or JSON logging mechanism to store transaction data for debugging and testing.
User Interface:

Create a simple CLI interface or web interface using basic HTML/PHP for users to select a payment method and process transactions.
Display receipt details or error messages based on the transaction outcome.
Exception Handling:

Implement custom exceptions (e.g., InsufficientFundsException, TransactionFailedException) to handle errors in a structured way.
Use try-catch blocks in the TransactionManager to manage exceptions for each payment gateway implementation.

Extensions and Additional Learning:
Add New Payment Gateways: Test the flexibility of the system by adding additional gateways (e.g., cryptocurrency).
Unit Testing: Implement unit tests to verify each gateway implementation independently, ensuring all gateway classes conform to the PaymentGateway interface.
Service Container: If desired, expand the project by integrating a simple service container to manage dependency injection.

Skills Developed:
Understanding and applying interfaces in a scalable, real-world scenario.
Managing dependency injection to make the system flexible and modular.
Enhancing code maintainability through interfaces, which supports future modifications (adding new gateways) with minimal code changes.
Developing error handling and logging strategies for production-level applications.
This project will provide learners with hands-on experience implementing interfaces in PHP, fostering a deeper understanding of modular, scalable design.
